## What?

I synced my settings files to github

## Why?

So I can have the same packages and settings at work, at home and on the move with my macbook

## And why didn't you use that other method with Dropbox/Google Drive?

I did, but it can present serious problems on sync. This is way is more safe for me.

## How?

1. The most !important step: **BACKUP your files**<br/>
Location on **Mac OS X**
`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/`
Location on **Windows**
`%appdata%\Sublime Text 2\`
